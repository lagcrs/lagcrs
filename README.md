### Hi there ðŸ‘‹:smile:

My name is Larissa Silva and I'm a Web Developer. I'm graduated in Systems Analysis and Development at Fatec :raised_hands:. I've always love to learn new things, so I'm constantly studying something new every day :ok_woman:. At the moment my focus is to deepen my knowledge in the Web Development Universe :heart:.
